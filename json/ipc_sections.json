Here A, whether the act be committed or \nnot, is guilty of abetting an offence. \n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under se ven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. \nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable \nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of th e unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of \nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong o r contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's \ninstigation.

A \ninduces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's \nproperty. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishon estly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of \nabetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is \nalso an offence. \nIllustration \nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in \nconsequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his off ence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B \nto commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspira cy that \nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficien t if he engages in the \nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \nIllustration \nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z.

Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. \n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is like ly to cause his death, strikes him with the intention \nof causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is g uilty of murder, although the blow might not have been \nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is \nlabouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of \nhealth, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such \nbodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cau se the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \nZ dies in consequence.

A is guilty of murder, although \nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \nException 1 .—When culpable homicide is not murder .—Culpable homicide is not murder if the \noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, c auses the death \nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \nFirst.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excus e for \nkilling or doing harm to any person. \nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of \nprivate defence. \nExplanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from \namounting to murder is a question of fact. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, \ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and th e death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in \ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provoc ation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable \nhomicide.\n74 \n \n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does no t believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has \nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \n(e) A attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of p rivate defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing \nso. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, an d kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was \ngiving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a by stander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and \nto cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only \nculpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of t he \nright of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to h im by law and causes the \ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without prem editation, and \nwithout any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \nIllustration \nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievo us hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the \nassault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other m eans prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has \nnot committed murder, but only culpable homicide. \nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a \npublic servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and \ncauses death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessar y for the due \ndischarge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the perso n whose death is \ncaused. \nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation i n a sudden \nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having t aken undue \nadvantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \nassault. \nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \nIllustration \nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years o f age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's \nyouth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder."

Here A, at the time of first moving the \nring, commits theft. \n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to h is shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters th e shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, \nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed crimi nal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \nwhat he did was not done dishonestly. \n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the wa tch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes \nthe watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z o f the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, \ninasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's poss ession without Z's consent, not having paid what he \nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's co nsent, with the intention of keeping it until he \nobtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express \nconsent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived \nthat he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft. \n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and cl othes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it \nis probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give aw ay alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed \ntheft. \n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes that property out of B's possession. \nHere, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft."

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum \n1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery. \n(b) A, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of \nselling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently \nfills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. \n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, s igned by A, without inserting the sum payable and aut horizes B to fill up the cheque \nby inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments.

B commits forgery. \n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and \nintending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the \nsecurity of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \n(f) Z's will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches \nout B's name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” \nand signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the wor ds “Pay to Z or his order ”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a b lank \nendorsement. B commits forgery. \n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated \nsix months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to \nZ. A has committed forgery. \n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes dow n a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the \nwill according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. \n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good characte r and in distressed \ncircumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. H ere, as A made a false \ndocument in order to induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. \n(k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain employment under \nZ.

A has committed forgery. \n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in orde r that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of \nexchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws \nthe bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending \nto cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decre e against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in co llusion with Z, executes a lease \nof the estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause \nit to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. \n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to de fraud his creditors; and in order to \ngive a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory no te binding himself to pay to B a sum for value receive d, and antedates the note, intending \nthat it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency.
